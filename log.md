# Test for *Estimation of self-exciting point process from time-censored data* from PHYSICAL REVIEW

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the methods outlined in the paper, which encompassed both the thinning method and four distinct thickening methods. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to compare these four combinations of thinning and thickening processes with the random method, all conducted within the same EM framework.

To begin our exploration, we initially relied on visual observations of the point process images generated by these proposed methods. This visual examination allowed us to intuitively discern how each method influenced the distribution by selectively thinning or thickening points in the process.

## Thinning

true: $\mu = 0.1 \quad \alpha = 0.9 \quad \beta = 1$ with 19 points in [0, 30]

origin:  $\mu = 0.9 \quad \alpha = 0.1 \quad \beta = 1$  with 35 points in [0, 30]

In our analysis, we deliberately chose extreme parameter values to discern the specific effects that different methods exert on the original sample point process. Utilizing general or typical parameters might obscure the unique impacts of each method. In this context, the 'truth' point process exhibits a high degree of concentration due to its large $\alpha$ value. Conversely, the original sample point process appears more scattered, owing to its smaller $\alpha$ value and larger $\mu$. Notably, our observations reveal that the thinning method primarily eliminates points that are closely spaced, aiming to maintain a relatively even distribution of the remaining points.

If the 'truth' point process exhibits a high degree of concentration, typically associated with a large $\alpha$ value, the thinning method may not effectively preserve the underlying pattern. Conversely, when the 'truth' point process is characterized by a more dispersed distribution, as seen with smaller $\alpha$ values, the thinning method can provide a more accurate representation of the true pattern.

When considering the same dataset as that used for thinning, the behavior of the thickening order method is starkly contrasting. It strategically inserts points within concentration intervals, resulting in a more compact and concentrated distribution. Consequently, if the 'truth' distribution is inherently uniform and evenly spaced, the thickening method may not adeptly encapsulate the intrinsic pattern.

Generate two data sequences using a common set of parameters: one as 'truth data' representing the ground truth, and the other as 'simulated data' that may be intentionally adjusted, such as through thinning or thickening order. Subsequently, apply the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate model parameters based on the corrected data and iterate it.

Our examination process serves as a litmus test for the accuracy of our method. To quantify this accuracy, we perform multiple iterations, computing the mean of relative errors across ten separate tests for each bin size. The truth values, as well as the initial estimated values for both mu and alpha, are randomly generated for each test, providing a comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness and reliability.
